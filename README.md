Decorator attach different responsibilities to an object dynamically

add a lot of features for custom objects

Commands allow us to process events.

Conductor saves history or redo commands.

Iterator class can iterate through any array.

Observables invoke upon change important for async

Strategies multiple algorithms for specific tasks

Change at runtime

Config initial/default and change dynamically at runtime
